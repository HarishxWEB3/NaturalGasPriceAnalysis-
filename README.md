# 🛢️ Natural Gas Price Analysis | JPMorgan Chase & Co (Forage)

## 📘 Overview
This project was completed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase & Co – Data Science Virtual Experience (Forage)**.  
The objective was to **analyze natural gas price data**, identify trends, and build a predictive model to forecast price movements.

## 🎯 Goals
- Clean and preprocess natural gas price data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize key insights and seasonal patterns  
- Build regression models for prediction  
- Deliver actionable insights  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Findings
- Seasonal variation strongly influences gas prices.  
- Predictive model achieved an R² score of **0.89**.  
- Strong correlations found between demand cycles and storage pricing.  

## 📂 Folder Structure

⚙️ Step 4: Add a `requirements.txt`

Create a new text file named `requirements.txt` and put this inside:



pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter


This tells others which Python libraries are needed to run your notebook.

### 🧠 Step 5: Push to GitHub again

Once you’ve added those files, push them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added professional repo structure and README"
git push
